### windows

On __Windows__,
1. Install mingw-w64 from [Mingw-builds](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds)

	* Architecture: x86_64
	* Threads: win32
	* Exception: seh
	* Build revision: 1
	* Destination Folder: Select a folder that your Windows user owns
2. Install SDL2 http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
	* Extract the SDL2 folder from the archive using a tool like [7zip](http://7-zip.org)
	* Inside the folder, copy the `i686-w64-mingw32` and/or `x86_64-w64-mingw32` depending on the architecture you chose into your mingw-w64 folder e.g. `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.3.0-win32-seh-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64`
3. Setup Path environment variable
	* Put your mingw-w64 binaries location into your system Path environment variable. e.g. `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.3.0-win32-seh-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin` and `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.3.0-win32-seh-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin`
